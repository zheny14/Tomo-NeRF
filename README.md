# Tomo-NeRF

Tomo-NeRF is a tool that allows you to perform ultra-sparse view tomographic reconstruction. This repository provides the necessary files for training, optimization, and testing of the Tomo-NeRF model.

### Usage: 

#### Data Preparation: 
Tomo-NeRF requires a set of 2D radiographic projection images. Ensure that you have a set of 2-6 images, evenly spaced from 0 degrees to 180 degrees.  Here we offers a set of real x-ray imaging and artificial image samples in compressed files (unzip before use).
